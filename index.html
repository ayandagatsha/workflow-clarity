                        Javascript, that will allow the program to 
                        accept those inputs and produce the output of 
                        performing the X, Y and Z functions?</p>

                </div>
            <strong><p> Here is the step by step psuedo code for you to follow:</p></strong>
            <p>Open up your top quality linux computer!</p>
            <p>First create a new remote repository (which is a folder basically) on github.com and name it. It will help track every change you make with your program/website.</p>
            <p>Copy SSH code of new repository (or repo for short) and open the linux local terminal</p>
            <p>keyboard keys to press: control + alt +t</p>
            <p>control + alt +t opens the terminal.</p>
            <p>In the command line of the terminal put:</p>
            <p>git clone >SSH code pasted. </p>
            <p>You can check the clone of the repo by entering in the command line:</p>
            <p>cd >name of repo. </p> 
            <p>git remote -v</p>
            <p>You should see 2 URLs and this confirms you can save all changes you make and access them again.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Next, in your local terminal, while in your repo, use the following touch command to create the first file:</p>
            <p>touch README.md</p>
            <p>A README file contains information about other files in a directory or archive of computer software. A form of documentation, it is usually a simple plain text file called Read Me , READ.ME , README.</p>
            <p>Start working on all the files for the program from HTML and CSS to Javascript.</p>
            <br>

            <div id='answerPublisher1' class='ans'>

                </div>
                <br>
                <p>To add all files or some files to remote repo for safekeeping and monitoring, use the following commands:</p>
                <p>git add.  (stages all files)</p>
                <p>git add >specified names of files. (stages specific files)</p>
                <p>git status (shows unstaged files in red and staged files in green)</p>
                <p>If you re-edit the files, you must re-add them.</p>
                <p>git commit -m ">file name" (add an extra space in the quotes and write more file names to commit more than one at a time.</p>
                <p>If you re-add edited files when committing, a short description in the quotes next to the file about your edit should be written, such as 'changed sentence >file name... etc</p>
                <p>git log (verifies files are in commit phase, ready to be put in the github.com repo you created.</p>
                <p>git push origin master (sends your files to github.com for safe keeping.</p>
                <p>git status (will verify your files existing locally and on the internet. :)</p>
                <p>Grab your link and share it or keep it somewhere safe. :)</p>
                <p>Congrats, you are a programmer!</p>
                <p>Soon you will be paid over $50 000 USD to program and develop sites and apps.</p>
                <p>Copy and paste this to google doc and edit it your work flow plan from there as much as required.</p>
